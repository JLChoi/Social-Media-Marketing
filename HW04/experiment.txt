HW04 - EXPERIMENT

For my experiment, I chose two of my favorite authors, Agatha Christie and Leo Tolstoy and I tried to see which 
author had the most similar writing in their books. 

HYPOTHESIS: I think Agatha Christie's books would be more similar since they are centered around the same theme: murder 
mysteries. I would assume that Christie would use similar language to describe parallel situations in her novels. On the
other hand, Tolstoy's novels tell different stories with numerous different characters, so there would be less overlap
between his works. 

EXPERIMENT DESIGN: I first went on Project Gutenberg to find txt files of the two authors' novels. Christie only had
3 novels listed under her name, "The Mysterious Affair at Styles," "The Murder on the Links," and "The Secret 
Adversary," so I downloaded those files. For Leo Tolstoy, I dowloaded the top 3 most dowloaded novels, "War and Peace," 
"Anna Karenina," and "Best Russian Short Stories." The reason why I chose the last work over any other is because
the rest of the works were short commentaries, so the short stories would have fit better with the genre in my 
experiment. 

After collecting all of these txt files, I ran the vector space model on the texts. I first created a corpus with the 3
Christie novels and another corpus with the 3 Tolstoy novels. Then, I ran the cosine similarity between each pair of 
books in the corpus and I averaged the similarities to get the overall score for the similarity between works of the
two authors. 

RESULTS: My hypothesis was correct, as Christie had an average cosine similarity of 0.0376, whereas Tolstoy had an
average similarity of 0.0069. The exact results are described below. Though Christie had a higher similarity, the 
average similarity is still very low. It was only pulled up by the high similarity between "The Mysterious Affair at 
Styles" and "The Murder on the Links". It might be possible that Tolstoy has more similarity in his writing, but 
the similarity may have been decreased because his works are so large compared to Christie's. If I were to run this 
experiment again, I would choose authors that have similar length writing.
