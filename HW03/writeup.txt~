WRITEUP

General Algorithm: Throughout this assignment, I used regular expressions to
find the information for my answers. First, I read all of the HTML on the
page and loaded it into my program. Then, I went onto each page and I
analyzed which parts of the page are relevant. After figuring out the parts
that I wanted to extract, I inspected the webpage and looked at the source
HTML to find unique tags and HTML dom structures to pattern match on to get
the data I wanted. 

1.
ANSWER:

Alfonso Cuarón was nominated for 5 awards, including Best Cinematography,
Best Foreign Language Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director,
and Best Picture.

ALGORITHM:

I first extracted the HTML from the first table on the main awards
page, which included all of the nominees for each category for the most
recent Oscars. Then, I extracted the headers of each of the entries in the
table to get the award names. As I did this, I also extracted the HTML within
these boxes for each award and I asked if it contained a string of query (the
person's name or movie name). If it did, I would add the award name to the
returned list. I patterned matched through all of the award boxes in the
table by starting from the back (for some reason the matcher returned the
last match first). In order to reach the other award entries, I ran the
matcher again on a subtring of the HTML that didn't include the entry that I
just matched to. I did this by taking the substring starting from the very
beginning of the inner HTML and then cutting it off where the start of the
previous match was, so I wouldn't keep getting the same match. By doing this
in a while loop and updating the HTML that I was looking at, I was able
to get all entries.

ANSWER:

If Beale Street Could Talk, Cold War, Can You Ever Forgive Me?,
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Mary Poppins Returns, First Man, Green Book,
Bohemian Rhapsody, BlacKkKlansman, Black Panther, Vice, A Star Is Born, Roma,
The Favourite

ALGORITHM:

I first isolated the data from the table at the bottom of the page which
tells you information about films with multiple nominations. Then, starting
from the bottom of the table, I looked at the entry that specifies the number
of awards the movies were nominated for. If this number is >= to our target
number, then I loop through the movies that have this many nominations and
I add it to the returned list. 

3.
ANSWER: Janet Gaynor in 1927

ALGORITHM: I first found the target award category link to the information
page. Then, I found the first table on the page and the first year that was
listed on it. After that entry, I found the corresponding winner which follows
right after the beginning of the table.

4.
ANSWER: 

The winner of the Best Original Screenplay Award was the Green Book and it
had a budget of $23 million and it made $306.7 million.

ALGORTIHM:

I first isolated the box that had the desired award type and then I found
the winner of that movie. Then I found the link to that movie's wikipedia
page and I looked up the budget and box office numbers in the table to the
right of the movie's information page.

ASSUMPTION:

The function takes in categories for movies.

5.
ANSWER:

Hale County This Morning, This Evening had the shortest running time out
of all of the nominees for Best Documentary – Feature.

ALGORITHM:

Similar to the last problem, I first found the box that contained the
nominees of our target award category. Then, I looped through all of the
nominees and went to their information pages to find their runtimes. I added
all of these runtimes and the corresponding movie to a list. Finally, I
looped through the list to find the minimum and I return the corresponding
movie.

6.
ANSWER: Fox Searchlight Pictures and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures were
tied for the company that distributed the most films that recieved mutliple
nominations.


ALGORITHM:

I first went to the table with multiple nomination movies at the bottom of the
page and I went through all of the movies there and found the links for all of
them. I followed these links and found the distributors or producers and added
them to a dictionary along with their counts. After iterating through all of
the movies, I found the company in the dictionary with the highest number and
returned the companies.

7.
ANSWER: For the countries nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, they were
nominated these number of times:

Lebanon: 2
Japan: 16
Poland: 11
Mexico: 9
United Kingdom: 2
France: 39
Germany: 11


ALGORITHM:

To find the number of times the countries were nominated, I first found
the countries that are represented by the nominees in the target section and
put them in a set. I did this by iterating through the nominees' information
pages to find their countries. Then, I checked the category type that was
inputted. If it was for Best Foreign Language Film, I would look up the number
of times each country was nominated. If it was a different category, I went to
the award info page and I went through all of the movies that were ever
nominated to find their countries and count the occurences of relevant ones.
This last part takes a lot of time and will run for over 10 mins.

ALGORITHM:

information from the table for people with multiple nominations at the
bottom of the page. From there, I looked at the entry that specifies the number
of awards the movies were nominated for. If this number is >= to our target
number, then I loop through the people that have this many nominations and
I add it to the returned list. 

ASSUMPTION:
