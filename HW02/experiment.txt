Description:

My simulator tests the effect of wealth segregation through the use of tax bracket
information. The information used is from 2013 tax filings. The way that I broke up
the brackets is by splitting the groups into those who pay 10% of their income to taxes,
15%, and 25%-33%. I excluded those in higher tax brackets because there were too little of
them to represent in the simulation. This is also the reason why I grouped the latter 3
tax brackets into one group.

Hypothesis:

If the overall population is lower, the homophily ratio will be higher because the groups
will have more space to clump together. If the overall population is higher, it will be
harder for the groups to live together, so the homophily ratio will be lower.

Experimental Methods:

I first hardcoded in the values to change the representation of the 3 groups, since they
are not all equally represented in the tax filing process. 27.4% of the population filed
in the 10% tax bracket, 42.2% of the population filed in the 15% range, and 30.4% filed in
the 25% to 33% range. Afterwards, I ran the visualizer on 3 different population sizes,
10000, 15000, and 20000, and collected the average homophily ratios for each of the 3
tax brackets. 

Results:

My results were consistent with my hypothesis. As shown on my chart, the homophily ratios
for all brackets decreased as the population size grew larger. Though the homophily ratios
didn't noticibly change between the population sizes of 15000 to 20000, the homophily ratio
jumped to about 91% from 88% when increasing the population to 10000 from 15000. As stated
in my hypothesis, one possible explanation for this is that the groups have more space to
congregate together, so they will clump together more often than when there are more people
and less space.

It is also interesting to note that in the population size of 10000, the 15% tax bracket
had the lowest homophily ratio, presumably due to the fact that it made up the largest
percentage of the population. Since there were significanly more people in that bracket
than compared to the other two, it was probably harder for the people in the 15% tax
bracket to congregate all together, as opposed to the other two tax brackets which had
less people. This further strengthens my hypothesis that if there are less people, it is
more likely that the homophily ratio will be higher.
